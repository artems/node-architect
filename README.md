# Architect

Architect is a simple but powerful structure for Node.js applications. Using Architect,
you set up a simple configuration and tell Architect which plugins you want to load. Each
plugin registers itself with Architect, so other plugins can use its functions. Plugins can
be maintained as NPM packages so they can be dropped in to other Architect apps.
